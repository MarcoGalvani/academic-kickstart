	abstract = {Simulation data are presented for a coarse-grained model of polycarbonate (BPA-PC), which allow for a detailed comparison of different ways to study the chain dynamics and predict the entanglement molecular weight. Most of the standard experimental quantities are determined for the very same set of systems and thus provide an opportunity for a detailed comparison of data far beyond typical experiments or simulations. By employing a suitably coarse-grained model, which still contains the essentials of the BPA-PC structure, simulation times compared to atomistic simulations could be extended by several orders of magnitude, reaching well into the characteristic experimental regime. We find that a recently developed topological entanglement analysis compares well with a direct determination of the modulus from simulations as with experiments on well-characterized samples. This confirms the extraordinarily small value of the entanglement molecular weight on Me between 1200 and 1400 corresponding to Ne close to 5.},

	abstract = {We present a new coarse-graining scheme for efficient molecular dynamics simulations of polycarbonate liquids and compare its effectiveness to that of a previously presented model which uses a different coarse-grained representation. The effect of more realistically accounting for the excluded volume of the phenylene comonomeric units in the coarse-grained simulation is examined. The new treatment avoids artifacts arising from sphere-packing, which dominate the liquid structure and dynamics in the older scheme, leading to a significant improvement in the equilibration time, for systems run at the typical processing temperature of 570 K. However, we observe only a slight improvement (10-4 eV/ atom) in the equilibration of atomistically detailed samples that are inverse-mapped from the equilibrated coarse-grained configurations. Distributions in the atomistically resolved backbone bond and torsion angles are identical using the two schemes, as are computed liquid coherent scattering functions. This indicates that artifacts present at the coarsened level are effectively erased by equilibration at full-blown atomistic resolution, at least for systems with relatively short chains well above the glass transition temperature.},

The method, which provides information on both static and dynamic properties, is tested for three different modifications of polycarbonate. The models successfully describe the variation in the Vogel—Fulcher temperature as well as the total chain extension. The effective speedup compared to the corresponding atomistic simulation is significantly above 103.},
